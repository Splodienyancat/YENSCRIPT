# YENSCRIPT
Basic JPY to USD conversion script with ability to update from the openechangerates API.

-Dependencies

wget, jq

-Setup

Just run the install.sh if running ubuntu

-Use

Run the program with -c arg for it to state current the conversion rate of JPY to USD
Alternatively run it with the -u arguement to update it whenever you want.
I personally like to set up an alias for the script though I dont see it being too useful for too many people.

-Notes

To my knowledge this ONLY runs on linux though it could run on windows through other means.

Made for ubuntu systems! Compatibility is unknown on other systems
